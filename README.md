# WhenAmp

A native music player, built in Rust.

Phase 1 targets macOS with a minimal feature set: load a song, play, pause, stop.
The audio stack (cpal + symphonia + rodio) and UI stack (egui/eframe) are cross-platform,
so Windows/Linux support is expected to follow without a rewrite.

## Build & run

```sh
cargo run
```

## Testing

```sh
cargo test
```

This repo tracks its git hooks in `.githooks/`. After cloning, enable them once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This wires up a pre-commit hook that runs `cargo test` before every commit.
See `AGENTS.md` for the test-coverage expectations for new features.

## Status

Phase 1: load / play / pause / stop / seek with a draggable progress bar,
no library or playlist support yet.
